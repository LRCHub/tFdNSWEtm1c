They have sent you a letter
To come back home to play
But to your dismay
This isn't your day
For the happy fun time has begun to fade
Watch as we reanimate our corpses you abandoned
And we're dismantled, we're mishandled
But we won't be skipped and swayed
Trapped within these walls
You left our souls to drip away
The ink decays The walls at bay
But the reckoning has come today
You say Boris has no guts 'cause
You replaced it with mechanical strain
We've been tortured
But we move forward
This disorder kills your day

I am alive
Immortalized
You're the creator
You traitor
Hey!
There's no vaccine
To cure our dirty needs
For now, you must
Build up our machine
You die tonight
Tonight
Build up our machine
You die tonight
Tonight
Build up our machine
You die tonight

So you found all the pieces
To initiate the pain
Our venom stains
The night remains
But the ending is always just the same
No gain
Nod your head to the beat of death
As you draw your last eternal breath
Sensations Of an invasion
Start to course right through our veins
You say we have no brains
We're just cartoons for your portrayal
To tell some tale about a boat and sail
But sure this inevitably unveils the fail
Splashes of eternal hate
Will flood the floor and clean the slate
Now we're tools!
And you're the fool!
Our nightmare dominates

I am alive
Immortalized
You're the creator
You traitor
Hey
There's no vaccine
To cure our dirty needs
For now, you must
Build up our machine
You die tonight

I am alive
Immortalized
You're the creator
You traitor
Hey
There's no vaccine
To cure our dirty needs
For now, you must
Build up our machine
You die tonight
Tonight
Build up our machine
You die tonight
Tonight
Build up our machine
You die tonight

I am aware
That your soul is now divine
We care not to toil with unbroken chains
So don't toil with ours
Like he did with our shining stars
So prepare for adventure
We're a whole new creature from the darkest side
You can't take away the pain we feel
Created as monsters that come to life
(Come back to life)

So you've come to the end now
Alive but dead inside
The heart beats loud
You've joined the crowd
We are but punished serpentines
Your life with him was fun
But now the terror's only just begun
Now come with me
And you will see
WE'RE A NEWBORN CYANIDE!

I am alive
Immortalized
You're the creator
You traitor
Hey
There's no vaccine
To cure our dirty needs
For now, you must
Build up our machine
You die tonight

I am alive
Immortalized
You're the creator
You traitor
Hey
There's no vaccine
To cure our dirty needs
For now, you must
Build up our machine
You die tonight
