They have sent you a letter
To come back home to play
But to your dismay
This isn't your day
For the happy funtime has begun to fade
Watch as we reanimate
Our corpses you abandoned
We're dismantled
We're mishandled
But we won't be skipped and swayed
Trapped within these walls
You left our souls to drip away
The ink decays
The walls at bay
But the reckoning has come today
You say
Borris has no guts
Cause you replaced it with mechanical strain
We've been tortured but we move forward
This disorder kill your day
I am alive
Immortalized
You're the creator
You traitor
Hey!
There's no vaccine
To cure our dirty needs
For now you must
Build up our machine
You die tonight

You're the creator
You traitor
Creator
You traitor
Creator
Hey!
Build up our machine
You die tonight
Build up our machine
You die tonight
You're gay, let's go back the day
You're gay, let's go
Build up our machine
You die tonight

You're gay, let's go back the day
You're gay, let's go back
You're gay, let's go
Build up our machine
You die tonight
You're gay, let's go back the day
You're gay, let's go
Build up our machine
You die tonight
You're gay, let's go back the day
You're gay, let's go back
You're gay, let's go
Build up our machine
You die tonight

So you found all the pieces
To initiate the pain
Our venom stains
The night remains
But the endings always just the same
No gain
Nod your head to the beat of death
As you draw your last eternal breath
Sensations
Of an invasion
Start the course right through your vein
You say
We have no brains
We're just cartoons
For your portrayal
To tell some tale
'Bout a boat and sail
But sure this uninevitably
Unveils the fail
Splashes of eternal hate
Will flood the floor
And clean your slate
Now we're the tools
And you're the fool!
Our nightmare dominates

I am alive
Immortalized
You're the creator
You traitor
Hey!
There's no vaccine
To cure our dirty needs
For now you must
Build up our machine
You die tonight
I am alive
Immortalized
You're the creator
You traitor
Hey!
There's no vaccine
To cure our dirty needs
For now you must
Build up our machine
You die tonight

Build up our machine
You die tonight
Build up our machine
You die tonight

I am aware
That your soul is now divine
We care to not toil with unbroken chains
So don't toil with ours
Like he did to our shining stars
So prepare for adventure
We're a whole new creature
From the darkest side
You can't take away the pain
We feel created as monsters that come
Come
Come
Come
Come
Come

Build up our machine
You die tonight
Build up our machine
You die tonight
You're gay, let's go back the day
You're gay, let's go
Build up our machine
You die tonight
You're gay, let's go back the day
You're gay, let's go back
You're gay, let's go
Build up our machine
You die tonight

Build up our machine
You die tonight
Build up our machine
You die tonight
